# 2021-08-16 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2021-07-19-biweekly]]

## News

### Auth

- Plan to drop Ory dependency. No Ory Hydra.

- IdP's can provide JWT and public signing key, so we can verify inside
  wharf-api without talking to remote IdP on each request.

- @fredx30 is reworking his RFC PR to acommodate these design changes.

### Problem handling

- All error/problem handling PRs by @Alexamakans has been merged and will be
  available soon in the next release of each component.
  
### Other

- Good progress despite vacation period!

## Plan

- @jilleJr is designing auth and communication flow changes for
  wharf-api <---> providers.

- Keep in mind to have a GitHub issue that captures a change in a big picture
  perspective. The problem/error response changes are a good example of when
  this was needed, but forgotten.

- @fredx30 continues on authentication followed by authorization via RBAC from
  the IdP's that support it (such as the Azure AD and G-Suite). Lots of RFC's :)

- @Alexamakans will work on using the new test result endpoints he implemented
  before, and presenting them in a proper way in wharf-web, as well as
  presenting the returned problem responses as toasts.
