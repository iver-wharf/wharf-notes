# 2021-05-21 Transfer tickets

- Censor/redact any company & internal service references

- Clean up descriptions and conclude worklogs as best you can

- Ignore prior prioritization, we reprioritize everything later

- Try to place new issues in appropriate repos

  - For those that does not fit any repo, use
    <https://github.com/iver-wharf/iver-wharf.github.io> and add the
    `admin` label

- Cancel tickets in Iver's ticket manager system once GitHub issue has been
  created, with the solution text:
  
  > Moved to https://github.com/iver-wharf/{repo}/issues/{issue-nr}
