# 2021-10-11 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2021-09-27-biweekly]]

## News

### Dev attendence

- As mentioned in last meeting, our time is being focused more and more lately
  on a different project.
  
  We've received the delegation that some of us can spend no more than 50% and
  others no more than 20% of our time on Wharf. These amounts is assumed to
  decline further in the upcoming weeks.

### Auth

- @fredx30: Progress has been slow, lots of back and forth with the internal
  teams on the Azure identity platform setup.

### wharf-api

- @jilleJr: Progress has been slow and steady regarding RFC-0016. Completed tasks:

  - Split up DB models: part 1 [#74](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/78)
  - Split rest of models [#67](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/83)

  64% done, according to the [RFC-0016 milestone](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/milestone/1).
  Although the splitting of models was a major one that blocked the other planned
  changes regarding RFC-0016.
  
- @Alexamakans: Fixed N+1 Build and TestResult fetch issue [#80](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/80)

- @Alexamakans: Removed Provider.UploadURL [#82](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/82)

### Refactoring/cleanup

### wharf-web

- @jilleJr: No progress on PR for adding third-party license attribution.

### wharf-docker-compose

- @frex30: Switch from filesystem to docker volume for postgres data mount [#8](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-docker-compose/pull/8)

- @frex30: Add TZ env variables to all backend services [#9](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-docker-compose/pull/9)

## Plan

- @jilleJr: Book meeting on "add nightly automatic releases based on `master`
  branch". Forgot to do this last week.

- @jilleJr: Continue work on wharf-api's RFC-0016 milestone

- @jilleJr: Continue work on adding third-party license attribution to wharf-web.

- @jilleJr: Try plan out Jenkins deprecation. Pick up that train of thought again.

- @fredx30: Continue work on auth implementation.

- @\*: Review PRs.

- @\*: Less time spent on Wharf due to new time delegations for other
  (non-Wharf) projects.
