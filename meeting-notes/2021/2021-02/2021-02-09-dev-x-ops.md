# 2021-02-09 DevÃ—Ops

There's too much of a split currently between the Dev and the Ops in Wharf.
How do we close this gap?

## Brainstorm

- Access to logs for both.
  - Devs access to logs of customer's instances
  - Ops access to joined list of logs
- Joined dashboard of all our managed deployments of Wharf (to customers)
- Coordinating rolling out new updates
- Have devs collaborate in upgrades/deployments
- Devs aid in support

## Action points

- Grafana view that accesses all Wharf instances
  - Consider sensitive information. API still logs keys in some places
  - Alerts
  - Security issue of transferring metrics from remote installations of Wharf

- Devs take notice on deployment issues reported by ops

- Release notes
  - Add to GitLab MR template
  - Add to coding standards onenote notebook
  - Add CHANGELOG.md to every repo

- Setup support channel?
  - Chat: Slack, Gitter
  - Reporting issues: Teams channel (forwarded issues from ops)
