# 2021-09-13 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2021-08-30-biweekly]]

## News

### Releases

- Release of wharf-provider-azuredevops v2.0.0
- Release of wharf-api v4.2.0
- Release of wharf-web v1.4.0
- Release of wharf-helm v2.0.0

### wharf-api

- Endpoints cleanup RFC-0016 for wharf-api is published:
  <https://iver-wharf.github.io/rfcs/published/0016-wharf-api-endpoints-cleanup>

- RFC-0016 implementation has not yet been started.

- Test results rework was haulted due to a regression bug, but is now ready to
  continue development: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/43>

### Auth

- Work by @fredx30 to grant access to production Azure AD as identity provider.
  Lots of bureaucracy, slow progress, long delay between emails.
  Need a premium instance of Azure AD to validate the test implementation fully.

- RFC-0013 is going forward. <https://github.com/iver-wharf/rfcs/pull/13>

- @fredx30 is gaining help from distant co-workers to help reviewing the
  solution from a security perspective. Using the ID-token on the back-end was
  concluded a bad practice.

### Azure DevOps imports from dev.azure.com

- Importing code repos instead of Azure DevOps projects as Wharf projects,
  and fixes the Git SSH URL when importing from <https://dev.azure.com/>.
  (<https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-provider-azuredevops/pull/31>)

- Some minor bugs were found in the above already-released changeset:

  - WHARF_DB_PORT collides with one provided by Kubernetes <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-helm/issues/21>
  - Cannot delete projects <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/issues/62>
  - Migrations in v2.0.0 didn't work <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-provider-azuredevops/issues/38>

  Work on this has been started, but no bug fixes are ready at the time of
  writing.

## Unit test coverage

- Work started by @Alexamakans, but then aborted as the rabbit hole seemed quite
  deep. The lack of testing in Wharf leads us to have little reference when
  adding new tests.

## Plan

- Finalizing the Auth RFC. @fredx30

- Start implementing the wharf-api endpoints cleanup based on the published RFC.
  @jilleJr

- Fix bugs and inconsistencies @Alexamakans

- Add GitHub Action to run tests and hinder PRs from merging

- Add "nightly" automatic releases based on `master` branch? Or a custom Wharf
  build in our internal instance that builds all images using latest code
  that can be built and deployed on the push of a button. Needs meeting.
