# 2022-04-25 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2022-02-28-biweekly]]

Not that biweekly anymore. We had a small biweekly-meeting hiatus.

## News

### wharf-api

- Now supports choosing execution engine on a per-build basis.

### wharf-cmd

- Almost 30 PRs merged since last biweekly meeting.

- Support for all step types.

- Runs using local files only, does not need your Git credentials.
  Creating a tarball that it sends to all step pods in Kubernetes.

- Uses your `~/.kube/config`, so no weird excess secret management.

## Plan

- Finish remining required features for wharf-cmd to run on our most
  complex internal projects that are using Wharf.

- Get wharf-cmd to run in Kubernetes, accessible via wharf-api.

- Get wharf-web to run locally without auth, then we can release the
  new version with auth.
