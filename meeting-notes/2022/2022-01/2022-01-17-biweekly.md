### Authentication

- @fredx30: Still in progress. Internal canary deployment help find some issues.

- @fredx30 & @jilleJr: Meeting with William regarding the authentication implementation. Concluded that:

  - Not focusing on niche customer requirements. We just need something better than Basic Auth.

  - Focus on implementing auth in our internal installations of Wharf for demos, internal security, and feature testing/evaluation.

  - No need to change Angular module loading in wharf-web depending on configs. Always loading auth module is OK.
  
### wharf-provider-gitlab

- Wharf-provider-gitlab v1.3.0 has been released!

### wharf-cmd

- @jilleJr: Created issues based on RFC-0025: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/milestone/1>
  Work can now start being delegated to multiple devs (given they find time).

## Plan

- @fredx30: Finalize auth implementation in wharf-web.

- @jilleJr: Will start working on RFC-0025 milestone.

- @Alexamakans: Continue work on supporting wharf-api v5.0.0.

- @Alexamakans: Check if possible to merge test details changes in wharf-web.

- @Alexamakans: Check if possible to merge remote project ID changes.

- @\*: Review PRs.

- @\*: Less time spent on Wharf due to new time delegations for other
  (non-Wharf) projects.
