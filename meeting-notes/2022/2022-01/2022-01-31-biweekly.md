### Authentication

- @fredx30: Still in progress.

## Plan

- @jilleJr: Continue work on wharf-cmd's RFC-0025 milestone.

- @jilleJr: Check up with leaders if we can delegate more review time, and/or
  lower the required number of reviewers per PR from 2 to 1.

- @Alexamakans: Away on vacation for a week. Progress haulted.

- @\*: Review PRs.

- @\*: Less time spent on Wharf due to new time delegations for other
  (non-Wharf) projects.
