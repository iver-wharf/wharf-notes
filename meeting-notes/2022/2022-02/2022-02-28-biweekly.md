# 2022-02-28 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2022-02-14-biweekly]]

## News

Full focus has been on the RFC-0025 "wharf-cmd provisioning" implementation,
with good progress.

### New developers

- @jilleJr: Been slowly onboarding two new developers: @Nisserino & @ZKemstedt.
  They will not work 100% on Wharf but instead one will only review and the
  other will only code some, as they are both new to Go and not dedicated Wharf
  resources.

  Have delegated two issues:

  - @Nisserino: [#20](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/issues/20) Use wharf-cmd-worker Docker image in wharf-cmd-provisioner
  - @Nisserino: [#28](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/issues/28) Collect build results from build pods in wharf-cmd-worker

### wharf-api

- @jilleJr: Created PRs to enable better wharf-cmd integration:

  - [#156](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/156) Added worker ID field to build
  - [#150](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/150) Changed build status query to accept arrays
  - [#147](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/pull/147) Added gRPC logging stream server

### wharf-cmd

- @Alexamakans & @jilleJr: Work ongoing on implementing RFC-0025 (<https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/milestone/1>):

  PR ready for review:

  - @jilleJr: [#59](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/59) Added swaggo docs to provisionerapi
  - @jilleJr: [#58](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/58) Added env var sub support

  PR WIP:

  - @Alexamakans: [#51](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/51) Worker gRPC

  PR merged:

  - @jilleJr: [#45](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/45) Added full support for other step types
  - @jilleJr: [#49](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/49) Cut await from last CR
  - @jilleJr: [#52](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/52) Fixed to fail on config error
  - @jilleJr: [#47](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/47) Added goimports linting to 'make lint-go'
  - @jilleJr: [#53](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/53) Removed duplicate k8s/core/v1 import
  - @Alexamakans: [#46](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/46) wharf-cmd-provisioner v1
  - @jilleJr: [#50](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/50) Read pod logs on failed start
  - @jilleJr: [#48](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-cmd/pull/48) Rewrote wharfyml package

### wharf-helm

- @fredx30: [#31](https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-helm/pull/31) Add web OIDC config

### Authentication

- @fredx30: Untouched. Waiting for meeting for final discussion points.

## Plan

- @fredx30: Book "pair-programming"/"pair-review" session for authentication PR
  in wharf-web.

- @jilleJr, @Alexamakans: Continue work on wharf-cmd's RFC-0025 milestone.

- @jilleJr: Consider remodelling a clean wharf-api DB structure. Our current one
  is starting to bite us a little.

- @\*: Review PRs.

- @\*: Less time spent on Wharf due to new time delegations for other
  (non-Wharf) projects.
