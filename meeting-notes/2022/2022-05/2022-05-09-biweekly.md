# 2022-05-09 Biweekly

Last meeting: [[2022-04-25-biweekly]]

## News

- Big demo upcoming. Showing the rest of the department our year-long process
  of replacing Jenkins, that's soon coming to a finish line.

### Most Go repos

- Updated to Go 1.18 :)

### wharf-cmd

- Successfully performed e2e test from wharf-web, through wharf-api, all the way
  through wharf-cmd-provisioner, wharf-cmd-worker, and wharf-cmd-aggregator,
  back to wharf-api and wharf-web. Yay!

### wharf-web

- Auth PRs are finally done. Can release wharf-web now, and let our internal
  installations start playtesting wharf-web's auth and wharf-cmd's engine.

- Angular 13, PrimeNG 13, NodeJS 16

## Plan

- wharf-cmd:

  - @Alexamakans: inject dev certs into `Dockerfile`s in `docker` step types
  - @jilleJr: last missing features for wharf-cmd's varsub
  - @jilleJr: create all-in-one Helm chart

- @jilleJr: Prepare for demos

- @jilleJr: Onboard @Pikabanga, new dev to the team.

- @fredx30: Maybe write down some auth notes: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/iver-wharf.github.io/issues/90>
