# Glossary

We need a new set of terminology for Wharf. Biggest issues is with the ambiguity
of "stage" and "step" which are overly generic words to be used.

Here's the list of all names that are found so far (add more if you come up with
more):

| Term | What we mean |
| ---- | ------------ |
| .wharf-ci.yml | The config file placed in the repo root that Wharf reads when executing.
| Build |
| Stage |
| Step |
| Step type |
| "custom stage flow" |
| Environment |
| Variables |
| Environment variables |
| Input variables |
| Builtin variables |
| Provider API |
| "Main" API |
| Wharf project |
| Wharf group |
| CI manager |
| CI executor |
| CI step executor |

## Brainstormed glossaries

The metaphor principle is not to be dismissed. It's a powerful tool that often
makes it easier for not only users to understand, but also for developers to have
it easier to appropriately name new features. We're exploring this concept in the
term of a "Theme".
